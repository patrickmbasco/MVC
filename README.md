# MVC
Your task is to write the service methods that will correctly update and delete a book. To update a book, you will have to use the setter methods from the domain model and then call the save method. As you can see, save is used for both creating and updating. To delete a book, you will have to use the deleteById method. Below, I have linked to the CrudRepository documentation.
